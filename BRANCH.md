`new-functions` is a medium-term branch for merging in new functions that are
intended to land in Sass 4.0. Once the module system is more solid, they'll be
merged into `master`, but until then we don't want to put out prerelease
versions with global functions that are very likely to be namespaced in the
stable release.

If we decide to release a Sass 3.5 before the 4.0 release, we may include some
or all of these functions in that release as-is.
